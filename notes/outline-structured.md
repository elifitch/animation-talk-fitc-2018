* Animation should be a first class citizen in web design
  * because it's a "builtin"

-------TRANSITION: because animation is a builtin, you can use it subtly influence users cognition------

* How to use animation to manipulate users' cognition

-------TRANSITION: it can do more than influence how users think, animation can also influence how users feel------

* How to signal your brand values with animation // how to evoke emotion with animation
  * first cognition (how to use animation for UI stuff), then emotion (how to use it to make users feel what you want them to feel about your brand/xp/whatev)
  * The building blocks of communicating with animation => how to use those building blocks to evoke the right feelings
  * Good idea would be to make a few demos, each different, one for a serious brand and one for an energetic brand; show the differences side by side

-------TRANSITION: now that I've sold you, lets talk about strategies to help your team adopt animation into your design practice------

* How to build animation into your process

## Structure 
### Intro
* All the intro things
### Animation should be a first class citizen
* A different way to think about design
  * Depends on a set of biological and cultural assumptions to...
  * harness how humans naturally process information to communicate more efficiently
  * If that's true (it is) then we're hard wired to extract more information from animation, making it even more efficient than static design to communicate
### Cognition
* Connecting state to state, action and reaction, affordances, etc eases cognitive load and helps things become more understandable, or be understood faster and more efficiently
* Helps people develop spacial relationships between states, develop "muscle memory"
* Performance: changes perception of time to make your site seem faster than it actually is
* Animate accesibly!
### Emotion
* Humans natually anthropomorphize, and it's possible to evoke emotions and sensations from your animation; tell a subliminal story about your brand
* The bulding blocks of character, and how to combine them to create subtle differences and evoke the right feeling
* How to combine building blocks to evoke the right emotion for your brand/site/experience
### Process
* All of this is moot unless you can integrate animation into your design practice
* Don't wait for permission, just do it
* Start early; storyboards during wireframes
* Interactive or video prototypes alongside visual design
* Styleguide
* Build a coalition of people; collaborate
